Lab wraps Git or [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub), making it simple to clone, fork, and interact with repositories on GitLab, including seamless workflows for creating merge requests, issues and snippets.

```
$ lab clone gitlab-com/infrastructure

# expands to:
$ git clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab-com/infrastructure
```

## hub + lab = hublab??

lab will look for hub and uses that as your git binary when available so you don't have to give up hub to use lab
```
$ lab version
git version 2.11.0
hub version 2.3.0-pre9
lab version 0.9.0
```

# Inspiration

The [hub](https://github.com/github/hub) tool made my life significantly easier and still does! lab is heavily inspired by hub and attempts to provide a similar feel.

# Installation

Dependencies

* `git` or `hub`

### Homebrew
```
brew install zaquestion/tap/lab
```

### Bash

Installs lab into `/usr/local/bin/`
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaquestion/lab/master/install.sh | bash
```

### Source

Required
* [Go 1.9+](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* [GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH)
* [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)
```
go get -u -d github.com/zaquestion/lab
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/zaquestion/lab
dep ensure
go install -ldflags "-X \"main.version=$(git  rev-parse --short=10 HEAD)\""  github.com/zaquestion/lab
```

# Configuration

The first time you run lab it will prompt for your GitLab information. lab uses HCL for its config and looks in `~/.config/lab.hcl` and `./lab.hcl`
```
$ lab
Enter default GitLab host (default: https://gitlab.com):
Enter default GitLab user: zaq
Enter default GitLab token:
```

# Aliasing

Like hub, lab feels best when aliased as `git`. In your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`
```
alias git=lab
```
